*Over View*:
*A Speech Recognition System is a machine learning-based model designed to convert spoken language into written text. It enables computers and digital devices to understand and process human speech, making it essential in applications like virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa), voice search, transcription services, and more.*

*The task of speech recognition involves several stages:*

*Audio Input: The system begins by receiving an audio signal through a microphone or an audio file.*

*Preprocessing: The raw audio is cleaned and transformed into a suitable format. Techniques like noise reduction, normalization, and feature extraction (e.g., MFCC â€“ Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) are applied to make the data more interpretable.*

*Acoustic Modeling: This step maps audio signals to phonemes, the smallest units of sound in a language. Deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used here.*

*Language Modeling: Language models predict the probability of word sequences to improve accuracy. They help the system choose the most likely interpretation of similar-sounding words based on grammar and context.*

*Decoder: The decoder integrates the acoustic and language models to generate the most accurate transcription of the spoken input.*

*Output: Finally, the recognized speech is converted into readable text and displayed or processed further as needed.*

*Modern speech recognition systems often use end-to-end deep learning architectures like Transformer-based models (e.g., Wav2Vec 2.0 by Facebook AI or Whisper by OpenAI), which directly map audio waveforms to text without needing hand-crafted features.*

*These systems can be trained using large datasets of paired audio and text, allowing them to learn speech patterns, accents, and contexts across various languages and environments.*

*Overall, speech recognition systems are becoming increasingly accurate, fast, and capable of functioning in real-world, noisy environments, transforming how we interact with technology.*
